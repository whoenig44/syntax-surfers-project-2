# Health Is Wealth!

## Description

We created this application because many people struggle with diseases and disorders that can be linked to the consumption of certain foods or certain behaviors. This app provides people a convenient way to choose the ingredients they want to track plus how they are feeling each day to see how these factors might be affecting their health.

We learned a lot about calling up APIs, routes, Sequelize, and deploying to Render while working on this project.

## Installation

This app is deployed on Render, so there is nothing to deploy. The user can go to [Render](https://syntax-surfers-project-2-deployment.onrender.com/) to use it. If you want to download it, clone the repository at [Github](https://github.com/whoenig44/syntax-surfers-project-2). CD into the client and server directories and do an npm install, and then do an install at the root. You can launch the app with npm run start:dev.

## Usage

Simplicity is the name of the game when it comes to using this app. Start by thinking about what you would like to track. It could be something like eating a particular ingredient (gluten, dairy, artificial dyes, etc.). Or it could be a behavior. It could be something that you think might have a negative or positive affect on your health (exercising, meditating, going outside).

Every day, you will record whether you did each of the behaviours. You will also record how you are feeling on a scale of 1-10.

Health Is Wealth! will generate graphs that combine all of the data you have entered. You will be able see whether or not you did each of the behaviors and how you were feeling each day. The goal is that you will be able to identify behaviors that are helpful or harmful to your own body so that you can make wise decisions each day.

## Credits

We did a lot of work to create this app, and we also got help from a variety of sources. Some of the files were modified from bootcamp activities. We also got help from tutors and AI.
